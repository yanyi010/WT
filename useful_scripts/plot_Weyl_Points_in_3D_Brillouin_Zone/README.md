# toolkits_plot_or_analyze

Usage: python2.7 plot_Weyl_Points_in_3D_Brillouin_Zone.py Node.dat 
where Nodes.dat are generated by WannierTools. 

Plot Weyl points (or Nodal lines) inside of the first Brillouin Zone of a given primitive unit cell;

If POSCAR is present, read it and calc the first Brillouin Zone according this sctruct file.

Add ky=0,kx=0 and kz=0 plane (polygon) inside of the first Brillouin Zone 
To specify the kplane, please modify myplane.py with the (kx,ky,kz) 3D coordinated of the polygon .
If you do not to show such plane, comment on face1 face2 and face3 in the main script.

To make it work, use python2.7 (from anoconda2) and matplotlib (pip install --upgrade matplotlib).
