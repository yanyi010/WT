Dependencies: 
This codes is only tested with python 2.7 on ubuntu. Sympy, spglib, and numpy are the
necessities. We recommend you to install anaconda2 which is a free Python distribution
from Continuum Analytics that includes SymPy, Matplotlib, IPython, NumPy, and many more
useful packages for scientific computing. 

Link for anaconda2: https://www.continuum.io/downloads, select "Download for Linux" and 
download the "Python 2.7 version", install it by "bash Anaconda2-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh" 
in your linux system. Don't forget to add "export PATH="/your/anaconda2/bin:$PATH" to
~/.bashrc and source ~/.bashrc. 
You can update sympy by "conda update sympy"

To install spglib, you have to download and install cmake(https://cmake.org/download/) 
following its README.rst firstly. Then you can do the following as
(Suppose your my current directory is /home/cmyue/Source/). Download spglib from 
https://github.com/atztogo/spglib.git and unzip it as "spglib"
cd spglib
mkdir _build; cd _build
cmake ..
make
make install
cd ..
cd python 
python setup.py install --user

Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bashrc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/spglib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export INCLUDE=/your/spglib/lib/include:$INCLUDE

and now do
source ~/.bashrc

Add Python environmental path variable which looks like
export PYTHONPATH=/home/cmyue/Source/Wannier_Hamiltonian_symmetrization/lib:$PYTHONPATH
to your ~/.bashrc. Do not forget to run source ~/.bashrc
